 Test and Upload to GitHub**

1.  **Install Pandas (if you don't have it):** Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python data_cleaner.py
    ```
3.  **Check the output:** The script should print the messy data, the cleaned data frame, and the final SQL statements.
4.  **Commit and Push:** Push your entire project folder (the `.py`, `.csv`, and `.md` files) to a new, public GitHub repository.

You now have a live, tangible project that validates your claim to be a **Data Automation Specialist**! You can include the link to this repo in all your proposals.
